## SpecDriven Development Workflow

This project uses **Spec-Driven Development**. Before implementing features:

1. Check `.spec/steering/` for project conventions and tech stack
2. Check `.spec/specs/<feature>/` for feature specifications
3. **Use the `spec-driven-implementation` skill** when implementing tasks

### Implementation Workflow

When asked to implement tasks, phases, or features:
- Load the `.github/skills/spec-driven-implementation/SKILL.md` skill
- Follow its instructions for reading specs and updating task status
- Mark tasks as `in-progress` before starting, `done` when complete
